Intelligent Video Surveillance System is an ML-driven application developed as a final-year project, designed for real-time anomaly detection in live camera feeds and video uploads. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms like CNN and LSTM, it identifies suspicious activities and generates instant alerts and also sends the notifications to the concerned authorities, enhancing security with a proactive, automated surveillance approach. This system provides a scalable solution for monitoring and responding to potential threats effectively.
